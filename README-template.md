## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts – Outfit

### What I learned

I learned how to properly use Flexbox to center elements both horizontally and vertically, and how to build a simple layout based on a visual design. I also learned to make my layout responsive and better control padding and spacing — especially on mobile screens.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:
- Explore more structured CSS methodologies like BEM
- Improve my mobile responsiveness workflow
- Use developer tools more effectively for faster layout debugging

### Useful resources

- [MDN Flexbox Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) – Helped me understand how to center the card layout.
- [Frontend Mentor community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) – Great inspiration and examples from others’ solutions.
